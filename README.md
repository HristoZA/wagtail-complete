# Wagtail with basic CMS features.

This project aims to include basic cms features out of the box, namely:

* Blog Posts
* Web Pages
* Categories
* Tags 
* Forms 
* Basic Bootstrap 4 functionality styling
* Streamfield blocks for a few useful bootstrap 4 features, e.g. the carousel.

My main aim with this project is as a learning exercise for Python, Django and Wagtail. Hoever, I also hope to have the project save me and other developers time with a boiler plate wagtail project.

For now, I'm just working on adding the basic functionality, but later on I do plan to implement cookie cutter to make it easier to use, and perhaps add a few other Django packages
